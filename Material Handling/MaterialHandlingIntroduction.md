#Materials Handling Introduction

#####The Space Based Manufacturing Specification defines appropriate aspects of Material Handling in order to enable a variety of manufacturing tools to leverage similar material options.

Material Handling are the systems which manufacturing feedstock materials are stored and transferred in a controlled manner to the Material Processing aspects of a manufacturing system.

In the current release of the SBM-Spec, the following Material Handling interfaces are defined:

Feedstock Canister: The feedstock canister is an enclosure for containing wire feedstocks for manufacturing and processing. It provides a safe environment for maintaining material integrity as well as access for control of feedstock in and out of the canister.

Throughout this document several approved spaceflight standards will be referenced in order to ensure new developments meet host platform requirements. In general, the defacto document to reference is the NASA Payload Safety Policy and Requirements for the International Space Station, document SSP 51700.
