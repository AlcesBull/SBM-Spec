##[Feedstock Canister](http://sbmspec.com/feedstock-canister)

######The feedstock canister is an enclosure for containing wire feedstocks for manufacturing and processing. It provides a safe environment for maintaining material integrity as well as access for control of feedstock in and out of the canister.

Up to 2 materials can be fed into the printer at one time. The canisters may be supplied power and data for commanding electrical subsystems for robotically manipulating the filament.

#####Physical Interfaces

The standard  `feedstock canister` interface is deisgned to accept up to **two** different materials at one time. The `exit ports` for the filament are shown in the diagram *needs ref*. Each part is capable of accepting filament up to `3mm diameter` with the nominal being `1.75mm diameter`.

The outer dimensions shall not exceed the dimensions listed in the diagram.

A handle shall be placed on the front face to provide a method for crewmembers to grip and pull the canister.

#####Electrical Interfaces

A `10-pin connector` is used to transfer power and data to the feedstock canister and is located in the rear wall. Both a 24V and 5V DC power source is available for the cartridge. The cartridge should be designed to self feed and retract the filament.
