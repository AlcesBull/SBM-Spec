##[Feedstock Canister](http://sbmspec.com/feedstock-canister)

######The feedstock canister is an enclosure for containing wire feedstocks for manufacturing and processing. It provides a safe environment for maintaining material integrity as well as access for control of feedstock in and out of the canister.

One filament can be fed into the printer at one time. The canisters may be supplied power and data for commanding electrical subsystems for robotically manipulating the filament.

#####Physical Interfaces

The standard  `feedstock canister` interface allows for rapid integration into payloads. The `exit port` for the filament are shown in the diagram *needs ref*. The feedstock canister can exchange `1.75mm diameter` filament with the payload.

The outer dimensions shall not exceed the dimensions listed in the diagram.

A handle shall be placed on the front face to provide a method for crewmembers to grip and pull the canister.

#####Electrical Interfaces

A `10-pin connector` is used to transfer power and data to the feedstock canister and is located in the rear wall. Both a 24V and 5V DC power source is available for the cartridge. The cartridge should be designed to self feed and retract the filament.
