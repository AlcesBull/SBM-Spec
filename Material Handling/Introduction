Materials Handling Introduction

The Space Based Manufacturing Specification defines the aspects of Material Handling in order to enable a variety of manufacturing tools to leverage similar material options.

Material Handling involves the processes by which manufacturing feedstock materials are stored and transferred in a controlled manner to the Materials Processing aspects of a manufacturing system.

In the current release of the SBM-Spec, the following Material Handling interfaces are defined:

Feedstock Canister: The feedstock canister is an enclosure for containing wire feedstocks for manufacturing and processing. It provides a safe environment for maintaining material integrity as well as access for control of feedstock in and out of the canister.
