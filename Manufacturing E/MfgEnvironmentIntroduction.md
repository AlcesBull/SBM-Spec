#Manufacturing Environment |
##Introduction

The Space Based Manufacturing Specification defines the aspects of the Manufacturing Environment in order to enable a seamless interface between material handling and processing in space to create a given object.

The Manufacturing Environment encompasses a wide range of aspects all necessary for a reliable manufacturing experience. A controlled manufacturing environment ensures a reliable and predictable manufactured end product, and thus the interfaces released in this document help enable a wide development ecosystem for constant improvement of the production of end-products. 

Throughout this document several approved spaceflight standards will be referenced in order to ensure new developments meet approved requirements. In general the defacto document to reference is the NASA Payload Safety Policy and Requirements for the International Space Station, document SSP 51700.
