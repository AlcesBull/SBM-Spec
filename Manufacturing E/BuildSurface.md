#Manufacturing Environment
##Build Surface

Build Surfaces are used as the base to grow 3D printed items on. In microgravity it is uniquely critical that parts are secured without the aid of gravity. The Build Platform is designed for quick removal and installation and can be run heated or at room temperature.

###Physical Interfaces

The Build Surface is designed to be quickly removed by simply retracting four threaded screws. The alignment of the threaded hole is critical and shall be to the dimensions shown in the diagram XXX. 

The outer dimensions shall not exceed the dimensions listed in the diagram.
