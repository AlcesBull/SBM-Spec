######Open source interface components and hardware design guide to create consistency and excellent user experiences across space-based manufacturing platforms.

###The Defacto Standard for Offworld Manufacturing

---Introduction Text :arrow_down:---

######The Space Based Manufacturing Specifications Manual is designed to establish a simple and consistent set of standards for plug-and-play design and code of space-based manufacturing technology.

As an Open Published format, the contents will be continually evolving. We welcome your support in future iterations. The current release makes available the interface standards for the core aspects for additive manufacturing techniques in space. These include; Materials Handling, Materials Processing, and the Manufacturing Environment.

Each of these aspects contains an assortment of interface descriptions that are open to the community to develop new hardware and software upon. We invite you to read through the interface releases and standards. These interfaces are currently in use by the MIS additive manufacturing and recycling programs (3D Print, AMF, R3DO). These interfaces are the cornerstone of our plug-and-play technologies, which means that as new technologies are developed by the community they can be
infused into current and future space manufacturing platforms.
