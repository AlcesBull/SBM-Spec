######Open source interface components and hardware design guide to create consistency and excellent user experiences across space-based manufacturing platforms.

###The Defacto Standard for Offworld Manufacturing

---Introduction Text :arrow_down:---

######The Space Based Manufacturing Specifications Manual is designed to establish a simple and consistent set of standards for plug-and-play design and code of space-based manufacturing technology.

As an Open Published format, the contents will be continually evolving. We welcome your support in future iterations. The current release makes available the interface standards for the core aspects for additive manufacturing techniques in space. These include; Materials Handling, Materials Processing, and the Manufacturing Environment.

Each of these aspects contains an assortment of interface descriptions that are open to the community to develop new hardware and software upon. We invite you to read through the interface releases and standards. These interfaces are currently in use by the MIS additive manufacturing facility (AMF). These interfaces are the cornerstone of our plug-and-play technologies, which means that as new technologies are developed by the community they can be
infused into current and future space manufacturing platforms.

##How to Use this Document

###For Hardware Desigers

The SBM-Spec enables hardware designers to create new capabilities for existing space-based manufacturing platforms as well as capabilities that conform well to new platforms as they come online. The standardized interfaces in this document may be leveraged by hardware designers to create added value sub-systems to enable a broader ecosystem of manufacturing in space. For consistent design practice, all interface descriptions in this document are be presented utilizing the metric system. Various standards documents are referenced in sub-sections of this document when they pertain specifically to given interfaces. Generally, any applications of the SBM-Spec where hardware that will be utilized in a crewed environment in space the hardware designer should reference the NASA Payload Safety Policy and Requirements for the International Space Station, document SSP 51700.

###For Software and Electrical Engineers

Software and electrical engineers may work simultaneously to develop control systems for expaning on current space-based manufacturing platforms. The SBM-Spec describes various standard interfaces which consist of an electro-mechnical aspect. In these situations the generation of software to control given processes may be necessary. In the current release of the SBM-Spec certain standard electrical connections are defined, however no specific software language or code base is defined for controlling electro-mechanical connections. 


###For Manufacturing Engineers

The SBM-Spec enables manufacturing engineers to build hardware according to a standard design specification. For consistent manufacturing practice, all interface and design descriptions in this document are be presented utilizing the metric system. Various standards documents are referenced in sub-sections of this document when they pertain specifically to given interfaces. The manufacturing engineer is encouraged to reference these documents when necessary to ensure that new hardware is built according to globally accepted requirements. Generally, any applications of the SBM-Spec where hardware that will be utilized in a crewed environment in space the mechanical engineer should reference the NASA Payload Safety Policy and Requirements for the International Space Station, document SSP 51700.
