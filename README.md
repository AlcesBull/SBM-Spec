###Offworld Manufacturing Specifications

######Open source interface components and hardware design guide to create consistency and excellent user experiences across space-based manufacturing platforms.

###The Defacto Standard for Offworld Manufacturing

######The MIS Open Published Interface Design Standards are designed to set a new bar for simplicity and consistency across space manufacturing platforms, while providing you with plug-and-build design and code.

###For Hardware Designers

######At Made In Space, we believe that the potential of offworld manufacturing is much larger than just the vision of one company. One day everything in space will be made in space, but only if we work together to make that reality happen. With your help, we can realize the true potential for bringing manufacturing to space.

The Offworld Manufacturing Specifications (OM-Spec) Manual represents over five years of study and and work beyond the state of the art at Made In Space to put the capability of space manufacturing into the hands of developers, designers, businesses, and consumers across the globe. 

As an Open Published format, the contents will be continually evolving. We welcome your support in future iterations. In the current release we are making available the interface standards for the core aspects for additive manufacturing techniques in space. These include; Materials Handling, Materials Processing, and the Manufacturing Environment.

Each of these aspects contains an assortment of interface descriptions that are open to the community to develop new hardware and software upon. We invite you to read through the interface releases and the standards. Each of these interfaces is currently in use by the MIS additive manufacturing and recycling programs (3D Print, AMF, R3DO). These interfaces are the cornerstone of our plug-and-play technologies, which means that as new technologies are developed by the community they can be infused into current and future space manufacturing platforms.

The future is what we make it, so letâ€™s make it a good one. Welcome to the future of Offworld Manufacturing.
