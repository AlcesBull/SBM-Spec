#Materials Processing Introduction

The Space Based Manufacturing Specification defines the aspects of Material Processing in order to enable a versatile assortment of end effectors and processing tools to leverage common interfaces.

Material Processing involves the techniques used to controllably reconstitute feedstock material into other, more useful forms. Material processing in the space-based environment involves the careful control of the feed material to maintain engineering tolerances on as-built parts.

In the current release of the SBM-Spec, the following Material Processing interfaces are defined:

**End Effector:** The end effector interface is defined as a volumetric body with a physical threaded hole pattern for mounting to a manufacturing system as well as an electrical connection for providing power/data to the end effector.

End effectors provide both invasive and non-invasive forms of processing and are used throughout many different material processes. Example end effectors include additive manufacturing extruders, subtractive manufacturing end mills, and inspection sensor units.
