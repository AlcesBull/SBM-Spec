#End Effector

#####End effectors can have a variety of used and locations to be installed. They can be a 3D print head as well as other peripherals such as subtractive manufacturing heads, metrology devices, post processing attachments, etc. 

####Physical Interfaces

The end effector interface allows for a single or dual extruder setup as well as other peripherals. When needed the entry ports for the filament are shown in the diagram XXX. Each port is capable of accepting filament up to 3mm in diameter with the nominal being 1.75mm. 

####The outer dimensions shall not exceed the dimensions listed in the diagram. 

######**Electrical Interfaces**

A 40-pin connector is used to transfer power and data to the end effector. Both a 24V power sources are available for the heating elements and motors.
